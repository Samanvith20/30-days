JavaScript Control Structures Demonstration
This project demonstrates the use of various control structures in JavaScript, including if-else statements, nested if-else, switch case statements, and the conditional (ternary) operator (? :). It provides examples and explanations for each type of control structure to help understand their usage and functionality.

Day03 - Control Structures

// Activity 1: If else statement
// Task1 > write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and log the result to the console.
// Task2 > write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age>=18), and log the result to the console.

// Activity 2: Nested if else statements
// Task3 > write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested if else statements

// Activity 3 : Switch Case
// Task4> Write a program that uses switch case to determine the day of the week based on number (1-7) and log the day name to console
// Task5> write a program that uses switch case to assign a grade ('A','B','C','D','F') based on a score and log the result to console.

// Activity 4 : Conditional (Ternary) Operator
// Task6> write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd and log the result to the console.

// Activity 5 : Combining Conditions
// Task7> write a program to check a number is leap year using multiple conditions (divisible by 4, but not 100 unless also divisible by 400) the log the result to the console.
