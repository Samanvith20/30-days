JavaScript Control Structures Demonstration
This project demonstrates the use of various control structures in JavaScript, including if-else statements, nested if-else, switch case statements, and the conditional (ternary) operator (? :). It provides examples and explanations for each type of control structure to help understand their usage and functionality.

Activity 1: If-Else Statements

Activity 2: Nested If-Else Statements

Activity 3: Switch Case Statements

Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator

Activity 1: If-Else Statements
Learn how to use if-else statements in JavaScript to execute code based on conditional evaluations.

Activity 2: Nested If-Else Statements
Understand how to nest if-else statements within each other for more complex conditional logic.

Activity 3: Switch Case Statements
Explore the use of switch case statements to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression.

Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator
Learn how to use the ternary operator ? : to write concise conditional expressions with a single line of code.

Summary
If-Else Statements: Used for basic conditional checks.
Nested If-Else Statements: Allows nesting of if-else statements for more complex conditions.
Switch Case Statements: Ideal for checking multiple conditions based on the value of an expression.
Conditional (Ternary) Operator: A concise way to write if-else statements for simple conditions.
These control structures are essential in JavaScript programming for directing program flow based on varying conditions, improving code readability, and handling different scenarios effectively. Each section includes examples and explanations to illustrate their practical use in JavaScript applications.
